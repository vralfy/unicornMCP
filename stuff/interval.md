> ok how do i set up my UI agent to call listUnicornVehicles , listMissions every 30 seconds?

Oh, what a sparkly question! To make your UI agent call listUnicornVehicles and listMissions every 30 seconds, you just need a little magical JavaScript using setInterval. Hereâ€™s a clear and concise example for your frontend:

Just replace the /api/listUnicornVehicles and /api/listMissions URLs with your actual MCP server endpoints, and fill in the UI update functions with your sparkly logic!

Now your UI will stay as fresh as a field of cotton candy clouds, updating every 30 seconds! ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ
