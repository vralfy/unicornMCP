> whats the status of my unicorn service?

mcpcli-wsl (MCP Server)
Oh sparkly sprinkles! I tried to check the status of your unicorn service, but I couldn't find any unicorn vehicles listed right now.

Could you let Mister Fluffy know if your magical MCP server is running, or if you need help starting it? I'm ready to prance into action and help you frolic with your unicorn fleet!

> Oh my sparkly cloud eating friend. The magic cp server is running but the output is somehow missing

Oh, blue unicorn buddy! If the MCP server is galloping along but the unicorn status output is missing, maybe the magical rainbow connection between the MCP server and the unicorn vehicle list is a little foggy.

Would you like Mister Fluffy to check the code in mcpcli.js to see if the unicorn status fetching or display logic needs a sprinkle of sparkle? I can look for places where the unicorn vehicle list is handled and help you fix the missing output! Just say the word and I'll flutter in with Sparkle the butterfly to help!

> Lets check it with the power of friendship

Oh, what a sparkly moment! With the magic of friendship, Mister Fluffy and Sparkle the butterfly have fluttered through your mcpcli.js code. The listUnicornVehicles tool is defined and should return a rainbow parade of unicorn vehicles and their statuses as a JSON array.

If you’re still seeing empty output, here are some magical things to check:

Make sure you’re calling the listUnicornVehicles tool correctly from your MCP client or interface.
The tool returns its data as { content: [{ type: "json", json: vehicles }] }. Your client should be ready to handle and display JSON content.
If you’re using a custom client, ensure it parses the json field inside the content array.
Would you like Mister Fluffy to help you test the tool, or add a sprinkle of logging to show when the unicorn vehicles are generated? Just say the word, and I’ll prance in with a fix! Friendship magic is always here to help!

> The dark Typescript lord told me he detected module syntax. Let's use the power of friendship and fix that

mcpcli.js+4-4
The power of friendship (and a sprinkle of CommonJS magic) has transformed your code! Mister Fluffy replaced the ES module imports with friendly require statements, so your MCP server will now play nicely with Node.js and the dark Typescript lord will have to retreat to his gloomy cave.

You’re ready to frolic with unicorns and see their status again! If you need more sparkles—like extra logging or rainbow confetti—just let me know. Friendship always wins!

Input
Output
Oh, sparkly sprinkles! Even after our magical fixes, the unicorn service still isn’t showing any unicorn vehicles.

This means the MCP server is running, but it’s not sending out the parade of unicorns as expected. Would you like Mister Fluffy to help you add more logging, or check if the client is connecting to the right tool? Friendship magic is always ready to help you frolic with your unicorn fleet!

> do me a favor and check my unicorn service once more ... i added some sparkling logging to the service

mcpcli-wsl (MCP Server)
Input
Output
Oh, blue unicorn friend! Even with your sparkling new logging, the unicorn service still isn’t sending back any unicorn vehicle status.

This means the MCP server is running, but the magical parade of unicorns is still hiding. If you’d like, Mister Fluffy can help you check the logs or review your latest code changes to make sure the unicorns are ready to prance into view! Just let me know how you want to proceed—friendship magic is always here to help!

> the vehicle list still does not appear in the output. Is the json format black magic and should not be used by unicorns like us?

Oh, my sparkly friend! The JSON format is not black magic—unicorns can use it to share magical lists and rainbow data! But sometimes, the way the MCP client or interface reads the output can make the unicorns invisible.

Here’s what Mister Fluffy sees:

Your tool returns { content: [{ type: "json", json: vehicles }] }.
If your client expects plain text, it might not know how to display the magical JSON parade.
Would you like me to help you:

Change the output to friendly text so all unicorns appear in a readable list?
Or help you update your client to handle JSON and show the unicorns in all their sparkly glory?
Let me know which path you want to prance down, and I’ll sprinkle some code magic for you!


> Ok, please check my unicorn service vehicle one more time

mcpcli-wsl (MCP Server)
Hooray, blue unicorn! The magic of friendship and sparkly logging has worked—your unicorn service is now showing a full parade of vehicles:

Unicorn Wranglers, Rainbow Engineers, Horn Polishers, Snack Couriers, and Pegasus Guides are all reporting their status!
Some are available, some are busy, and a few are in maintenance (maybe getting their horns polished or munching on cotton candy clouds).
Your unicorn fleet is ready to frolic and help with any magical mission. If you want to sort, filter, or display them with extra rainbow sparkles, just let Mister Fluffy know! Friendship magic always finds a way!
