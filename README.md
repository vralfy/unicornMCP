# UnicornMCP

Welcome to UnicornMCP! ðŸ¦„âœ¨

UnicornMCP is a magical Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing unicorn missions in a sparkling city full of rainbow roads and enchanted creatures. Dispatch unicorn vehicles, resolve magical incidents, and keep the city shining with joy!

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables seamless communication between AI assistants and various tools, resources, and data sources. Think of it as a magical bridge that connects your AI assistant to external services and capabilities! âœ¨

MCP allows AI assistants to:

- **Access Tools**: Execute functions and commands in external systems
- **Read Resources**: Fetch data from files, databases, APIs, and other sources
- **Maintain Context**: Keep track of ongoing conversations and state across interactions
- **Extend Capabilities**: Add new functionality through modular components called "servers"

In our enchanted unicorn world, MCP acts as the magical communication system that lets AI assistants interact with our unicorn dispatch system, manage missions, assign vehicles, and spread joy throughout the rainbow city! ðŸŒˆ

The protocol is designed to be:

- **Secure**: All communications are properly authenticated and authorized
- **Extensible**: New tools and resources can be easily added
- **Standardized**: Works consistently across different AI assistants and platforms
- **Magical**: Okay, maybe that last one is just for our unicorn implementation! ðŸ¦„ðŸ’–
