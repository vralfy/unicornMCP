## Concept
In a magical city, unicorns are the main mode of transportation. Sometimes, unicorn traffic jams occur, rainbow roads need repairs, and unicorns require horn-polishing or magical snack deliveries. The MCP server coordinates all these operations, dispatching specialized teams to resolve unicorn-related incidents.

## Example Missions
Unicorn Jam Clearance:
- A group of unicorns is blocking a rainbow intersection. Dispatch “Unicorn Wranglers” to clear the jam.
Rainbow Road Repair:
- A section of the rainbow road has faded. Send “Rainbow Engineers” to restore its colors.
Horn Polishing Emergency:
- A unicorn’s horn has lost its shine before a parade. Assign “Horn Polishers” for a quick fix.
Magical Snack Delivery:
- Unicorns are hungry and refuse to move. Send “Snack Couriers” with enchanted treats.
Lost Pegasus Assistance:
- A confused pegasus is causing traffic chaos. Deploy “Pegasus Guides” to help.
