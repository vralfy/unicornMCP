## Concept
In a magical city, unicorns are the main mode of transportation. Sometimes, unicorn traffic jams occur, rainbow roads need repairs, and unicorns require horn-polishing or magical snack deliveries. The MCP server coordinates all these operations, dispatching specialized teams to resolve unicorn-related incidents.
