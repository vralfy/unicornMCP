# Code generation instructions

1. **Code Style and Structure**:
   - Follow the existing code structure and conventions.
   - Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
2. **Performance**:
   - Ensure the script runs efficiently as it operates in real-time within the browser.
   - Avoid introducing performance bottlenecks.
3. **Compatibility**:
   - Use only modern JavaScript features supported by most browsers.
   - Avoid dependencies on external libraries not already included in the project.
4. **Functionality**:
   - Focus on improving or extending existing features, such as:
     - Automatic vehicle assignment.
     - Mission sorting and filtering.
     - UI enhancements for better usability.
   - Do not alter the core functionality of the game.
5. **Settings and Data**:
   - The script uses `localStorage` for storing user settings.
   - Additional data (e.g., vehicle types, scenes) is fetched from external sources like GitHub.
6. **Comments**:
   - Add meaningful comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code.
